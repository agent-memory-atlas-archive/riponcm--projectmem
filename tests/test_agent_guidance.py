"""What we actually tell the model.

Two reports against 0.3.2 that were not code bugs but gaps in guidance:

  #14 — Antigravity called tools without a project name, got refused, read the
        error, and retried correctly. A wasted round trip every session,
        because nothing ever told it the name.

  #17 — summary.md accumulated contradicting decisions. `supersedes` has
        existed since 0.1.4 and the summary renderer honours it, but
        AI_INSTRUCTIONS.md mentioned it zero times in 12,503 characters, so
        models never called it. The reporter's own model said as much.

These assert the guidance exists on every surface a client might read. They are
deliberately about content, not formatting.
